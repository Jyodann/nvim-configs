# Jyodann's Nvim Configuration

Simply installs packer for Neovim and installs packages like:

- lualine
- nvim-tree
- telescope
- treesitter

For treesitter, it installs all language linting, so may take while for all of them to install.

To use, simply just clone this repo to your nvim config directory, and rename this folder to 'nvim'
